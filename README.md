Note: When you open the project with the unity editor, first open the scene named "Start" and then set the Resolution to 1920x1080.      
Note: When this project was done, I did not encounter any bugs. But when I opened it to upload it to Git Hub, I encountered a few bugs. There are a few bugs in the game even though they didn't significantly affect the gameplay of the game.

The details of the given project are as follows:

Final Project      
This video game project is a remake of the Metal Gear 1988 game originally "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal_Gear_(video_game)". It offers 30 minutes of gameplay. The game has 3 different levels, 3 different boss battles, 1 mini-boss battle, and 3 different undertale boss battles. There are sellers at certain points in the game. With the money the player earns by killing enemies, the player can strengthen his/her weapons and buy bullets/grenades from the seller. In addition, the player can increase his/her right to hide in the box, which is a special ability, from the seller.

W/A/S/D --> Move      
Space --> Attack for all Weapons      
1/2/3/4 --> Switch between Weapons      
B --> Grenade       
H --> Hide in the box      
G --> Increase health by eating chocolate
